# MISC 
Single Stocks 
-iShares Core High Dividend ETF (Should be put in a tax advantaged account) 
# To Do 
- Rebalance to The** Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)** for Roth IRA in 2030
 
# Notes 
"Moreover, mutual funds will automatically
reinvest all dividends back into the fund whereas additional
transactions could be required to reinvest ETF dividends. We
recommend that individuals making periodic contributions to a
retirement plan use low-cost indexed mutual funds rather than
ETFs."
