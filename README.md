# Notes 
"Moreover, mutual funds will automatically
reinvest all dividends back into the fund whereas additional
transactions could be required to reinvest ETF dividends. We
recommend that individuals making periodic contributions to a
retirement plan use low-cost indexed mutual funds rather than
ETFs."
